# pong-game
The classic pong game. 
This version of Pong is a table tennis-themed 1-player 2D arcade video game. The game consists of two paddles/strikers, located at the left and right edges of the screen, and a ball. The player will compete vs a computer. The basic theme of this game is to make sure that the ball doesn’t hit the wall behind you. If it does, the opponent scores a point. And if the ball touches the opponent’s wall, you score a point.
